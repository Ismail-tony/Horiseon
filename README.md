# Horiseon Social Solution Service

## Description 

The Horiseon Webpage was created as a week-1 challenge for the HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. This challenge is to convert a non-semantic html structure into a semantic structure to make it more accessible to navigate.
The next step is to push all the changes made to the page into the repository created on github to reflect the changes made in the repository on the local machine. And lastly, once everything is up and running perfectly, the application needs to be deployed on Githhub URL.

## Installation

1. Creating a repository that has a README on github for the challenge.
2. cloning the repository to use in VSCode on the local machine.
3. Launching VS code on the repository file.
4. Creating a Main origin in the cloud repository using the git command: pull, commit -m and push.
5. Downloading the Starter file into the repository on the local machine to get started coding.
